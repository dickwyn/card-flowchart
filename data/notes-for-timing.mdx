**NOTES ON TIMING:**

**If you are near 5/24, it might be worth waiting** until you are under 5/24 again, instead of grabbing a ton of new cards immediately. **It's up to you how long a wait is worth it** - personally, I would definitely wait at least a few months - maybe even several, since you can grab many biz cards while waiting.

You might decide to (regularly?) check in a Chase branch for any **Chase CC preapprovals - these get around the 5/24 rule **(but do not appear to get around the "one Sapphire" bonus rule).

Amex sends out **targeted mailers / emails / Amex offers that don't have the once-per-lifetime limitation**.

The optimal time to get the SW cards is so that **all bonuses **post in Jan/Feb, giving you the CP for almost 2 years.

Some of the premium cards (Amex Platinum, Amex PRG, Citi Prestige, Ritz, CNB Crystal Visa, etc.) offer calendar-year airline/travel credits - if you apply at just the right time (usually late Nov.-ish / early Dec.-ish, depending), **you can triple-dip the credit** in your first card year before downgrading/canceling.
