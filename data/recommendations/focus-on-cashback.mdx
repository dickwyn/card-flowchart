Note that (like many banks) Capital One can be quite sensitive to the number of inquiries and/or new accounts, so check recent DPs for approvals before going for Capital One cards if you are sitting on a lot of new cards/inquiries in the past 24 months. Carrying a balance on other cards :/ also seems to help approval.
