**Get however many of these cards you can** (given your 5/24 status) in the order most valuable to you. **Recommended application rate is 1 new Chase card every 2-3 months, depending on current offers and risk tolerance! **My suggested order:

1.  Barclays AA Biz (can skip if only interested in cashback)
2.  Any Chase biz cards as you want to try to get\* - **<u>but you may be denied for them right now</u>**
3.  SW personal card of choice\*\*
4.  CSR (if focus is travel) or CSP (if only interested in cashback)
5.  World of Hyatt (or Chase Freedom Flex, if focusing on cashback)
6.  United Explorer (or Chase Freedom Unlimited, if focusing on cashback)
7.  Pick the best one for you: Chase BA Visa / IHG / Freedom Flex / Freedom Unlimited (skip if after cashback)

**If you can't get approved for the SW Biz card currently, it will be very difficult to get the SW companion pass right now.** You'll need a lot of MS or organic spend on the SW personal card to get the companion pass (which might get you shut down by Chase), and/or advanced strategies. See the What Card Wednesday thread for more details.

**SW RRs cannot be redeemed for Amazon GCs now, but I'm guessing that won't be the case forever.**
