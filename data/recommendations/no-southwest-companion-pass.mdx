**Get however many of these cards you can** (given your 5/24 status) in the order most valuable to you.

**Recommended application rate is 1 new Chase card every 2-3 months, depending on current offers and risk tolerance! **My suggested order:

1.  Barclays AA Biz

2.  Any Chase biz cards as you want to try to get\* - **<u>but you maybe denied for them right now</u>**
3.  CSR (the CSR is always superior to the CSP if you're interested in travel)\*\*

4.  World of Hyatt

5.  United Explorer
6.  SW personal card of choice
7.  Pick the best one for you: Chase BA Visa / IHG / Freedom Flex / Freedom Unlimited

(SW RRs cannot be redeemed for Amazon GCs right now, but I'm guessing that won't be the case forever.)

I'd go for at least the Barclay AA Biz early on in your Chase journey, as it doesn't count against 5/24 and can be hard to get later.

**<u>If you are just starting out, you will probably want to stay under 5/24 indefinitely by alternating Chase apps with biz cards that don't count against 5/24, at least until you can start getting Chase biz cards again - see the WCW thread!</u>**
