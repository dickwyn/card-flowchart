**If you are new to credit card churning**: Please go read all of the resources on the /r/churning sidebar before starting to apply for cards. **If churning in 2-player mode, don't add your partner as an authorized user while under 5/24!**

**If you are just starting out with CCs in general/have a thin credit file**, you will need to build credit history before going for the bigger cards listed in this guide.

In that case, **the best starter cards** (in my opinion) are the Chase Freedom and Discover It - get one (or both), use them responsibly for a year to build your credit history, and then you can start with the other cards in this guide.

**If you're a student** and need to build credit history, the best starter cards are the Discover It Student and/or a Capital One student card. You might also be approved for a Chase Freedom, but you're almost guaranteed to be approved for Discover and Capital One student cards. (There's also a new Chase Freedom Student card, but it's definitely not as good as the Discover, and maybe not even as good as the Capital One.)
