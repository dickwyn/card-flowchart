**NOTES ON CHASE CARDS:**

For a while, Chase shutdowns were becoming more common (see http://redd.it/8qi6aa/ - the main causes appeared to be 1. applying for too many Chase cards too quickly, and 2. applying for a new Chase card if 12+/24, including non-Chase cards). **However, there have been far fewer shutdowns reported recently**, so it is likely safe to apply for cards faster than in the recent past - 1 new Chase card every 2-3 months, depending on offer availability and your risk tolerance. **If you want to increase your card velocity while going after Chase cards, you can sprinkle in biz card apps from Amex, BoA, Citi, and the Barclay AA Biz while chasing Chase 5/24 cards, since those don't count against 5/24.**

**<u>Chase biz card approvals are very YMMV at the moment - some people are now being approved with sole prop applications, while others continue to get denied - so keep that in mind when reading the below notes and when deciding whether to go for Chase biz cards right now or not.</u>**

**<u>Also, if you're going for cashback, you may want to get some Capital One cards before getting Chase personal cards, as Capital One cards can be very difficult to get once you pass 5/24.</u>**

\* Though Chase used to not allow you to have more than 1 biz card at a time, many (most?) people are now reporting success, so **you can decide how many additional biz card apps you want to add before you hit 5/24** (Ink Preferred, SW, United, Ink Cash, **<u>maybe</u>** Marriott, and/or Ink Unlimited).

\*\* If you are 0 or 1/24, you **<u>may</u>** want to start with the Chase Marriott Boundless first. **Getting the Chase Marriott Boundless means that you can't get the Amex Marriott cards for 24 months after receiving your last Chase Marriott card bonus**, but since churning is a marathon, there are enough cards for someone who is just starting out to get to occupy 24 months of CC apps, so it may make sense to grab the Marriott card <u>first</u> to get your 24 month clock ticking and then move on to the other Chase cards, and then onto the non-Amex banks, so you can then get the Amex Marriott cards down the road.

The Ink Preferred (and other Chase biz cards) don't count against 5/24.

**If you're focusing on cashback**, note that URs can be redeemed for 1 cent each (or more, with Pay Yourself Back); SW points can be redeemed for 1 Amazon cent per mile (**5/14/2020 note - this is currently not true, but I expect this option to come back eventually**); and United miles can be redeemed for 0.6 Amazon cents per mile.

**Be sure to respect Chase's 2/30 rule. **Chase may deny you for too many apps even if you respect 2/30.

Finally - there are more advanced aspects to CC churning that are outside the scope of this flowchart, (e.g., MS, MDD, credit triple-dipping) that you must research on your own if you're interested. Start by reading a few What Card Wednesday threads.
