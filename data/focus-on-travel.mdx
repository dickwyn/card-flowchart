This is where things get even more subjective - essentially, **you should start working your way down the list from biggest sign-up bonus to smaller bonuses **(while taking into account banks' application rules and sensitivity to inquiries/new accounts), which is both subjective and an ever-changing target. However, here's a good default list to follow; please tailor to your needs.

To maximize your odds of approval, you'll want to spread applications around among banks over time (except where strategically combining HPs), and **respect banks' application rules** (Amex's 2/90, Barclay's 6/24, Citi's 8/65 and 6/6, Chase's 2/30, BoA's 2/3/4, etc. **Check out the guide to banks' anti-churning rules here: http://redd.it/819r08/**):

1.  Barclays AA and Barclays JetBlue Plus (I'd try for a double-dip - apply first for whichever one you want more) and Barclays AA Biz - all now seem to be subject to 6/24, so I'd just try for all the Barclay cards you can as soon as you go over 5/24

2.  Possible BoA app-o-rama on the same day as the Barclays apps, if you can do all the minimum spends - Premium Rewards, Alaska Biz, and one of the Alaska Personal,  Asiana, or Virgin Atlantic. BoA approvals have become a bit of a black box to me, so I'd just try for 2 personal and 1 biz in the same day and see what sticks.
3.  Citi AA Platinum if under 6 inquiries in past 6 months (6/6 seems to be a soft rule, but it applies to many)
4.  (8+ days later) CitiBusiness AA if under 6 inquiries in past 6 months and have 5+ yrs of credit history
5.  **(Barclays, US Bank, and Citi are usually more inquiry sensitive than other banks on this list - the order of the cards below this line is more flexible**)
6.  Targeted 100k Amex personal platinum offer (if you have no Amex cards at the moment)
7.  Some Citi TY card if under 6 inquiries in past 6 months - hold out for a 50k+ TY point bonus. **Premier/Prestige seem to require 0 inquiries in past 6 months for approval right now for many people!**
8.  US Bank Leverage Card
9.  Amex Marriott Brilliant (don't go over 2/90 with Amex)
10. Amex Marriott Biz
11. The Amex charge cards - Gold, BRG, Biz Plat, 25k Green, etc. (and personal Plat, if no 100k offer for you), and the other Plat flavors (Morgan Stanley, Schwab)
12. Amex Delta and Hilton cards
13. BoA app-o-rama once your HPs and new accounts are low, if not done early on
14. Capital One Venture once your HPs/new accts are low
15. HSBC Cards (need a Premier Checking account with them - grab one when there's a \$450+ sign-up bonus for the checking account)
16. US Bank Altitude Reserve (**don't** buy gift cards [not even retail GCs] on this card) - can probably only get it if you have 0 inquiries/new accounts in the past 6 months. **<u>Alternatively, if you're planning on staying under 5/24 indefinitely, you might want to get this card FIRST, even before any Chase cards!</u>**
17. Other cards - PNC, Radisson, Wyndham, etc., once you're eligible based on the bank's application rules
18. One-off CU credit cards with big bonuses - follow Doctor of Credit to stay informed

Best travel cards for ongoing/unbonused spend - pick your favorite currency:

1.  For MRs: Amex Blue Biz Plus
2.  For URs: Chase Freedom Unlimited (get by PCing CSP or CSR) or Chase Ink Unlimited
3.  For TYs: Citi DoubleCash (get by PCing Citi AA personal or Citi Premier)
