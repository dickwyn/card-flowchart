This flowchart obviously won't cover every situation, and it doesn't take into consideration reaching a specific destination; **the advice here aims to maximize your points and miles in general (particularly flexible points) with an eye toward travel**, especially international F and J travel. But, it will not account for every increased sign-up bonus promo going on at any given time - **this is a general (and subjective) guide, not absolute truth.**

To be clear about my point of view, **this guide treats flexible, transferable points (URs and MRs) as the most desirable currencies.** (Citi TYs are also desirable, but with Citi's 24 month rule, it's hard to acquire large numbers of TY points easily, so TY points don't feature prominently in this guide.)

With the move to dynamic pricing in awards, this guide treats all airlines miles as roughly equally (un)desirable. **Valuation of airline miles is personal, highly subjective, and very dependent on your individual travel goals**, so you should take this list as a general guide but customize your plan based on your travel goals.

Also, **this guide assumes that you have no problems meeting any minimum spends** - if meeting minimum spends is an issue for you, you have additional value considerations to make that are beyond the scope of this flowchart. **The guide also assumes you're fine with grabbing business cards** - there's really no reason to avoid them, so this guide doesn't.

**It is your responsibility to evaluate the pros/cons of any particular credit card for yourself and to plan to meet the minimum spend** - you shouldn't be applying for credit cards just because some guy on the internet told you to.

Keep in mind that **credit card churning is a marathon, not a sprint** - it will take multiple years to grab most/all of the cards listed on this page.

It's also your responsibility to **ensure you're applying for the best bonus available**, especially for Amex cards.

Also, if you're in Amex pop-up jail and can't get Amex bonuses, there's not much you can do except put more spend on your existing Amex cards and hope to get out of jail sometime.
